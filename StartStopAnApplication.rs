// here's a simple example in Rust of how to start and stop an application:

use std::process::Command;

fn main() {
    // Start the application
    let mut start_app = Command::new("application_name")
        .arg("start")
        .spawn()
        .expect("Failed to start application");

    // Wait for the application to finish
    let status = start_app.wait().expect("Failed to wait on application");

    // Check the status of the application
    match status.code() {
        Some(code) => println!("Application exited with code: {}", code),
        None => println!("Application was terminated by a signal"),
    }

    // Stop the application
    let stop_app = Command::new("application_name")
        .arg("stop")
        .spawn()
        .expect("Failed to stop application");

    // Wait for the application to stop
    let status = stop_app.wait().expect("Failed to wait on application");

    // Check the status of the application
    match status.code() {
        Some(code) => println!("Application exited with code: {}", code),
        None => println!("Application was terminated by a signal"),
    }
}
